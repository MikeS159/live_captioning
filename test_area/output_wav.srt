1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Right, there, I'm finished.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,599
 You're finished.

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:08,199
 I'm finished.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:08,839
 I'm done.

5
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,839
 I mean, I think it's done.

6
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,839
 Do you want me to have a read?

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,336
 No.

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,736
 No, it's fine. Unless... do you want to?

9
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,736
 Do you want me to?

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,216
 Right, yeah, no, no, you probably should.

11
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:25,655
 Okay?

12
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,675
 Actually, can you not?

13
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:28,876
 No.

14
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:31,315
 No, and it's not that I don't want you to.

15
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:32,756
 I do, obviously.

16
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:35,295
 It's just, I know you'll find those wrong with it.

17
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,176
 And then you'll make me change it and make you change it.

18
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,176
 And then I'll start worrying about all the other things

19
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,176
 to wrong with it.

20
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,415
 I won't make you change it.

21
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:43,936
 And then I'll never actually send it

22
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,655
 and we'll be right back where we started.

23
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:47,936
 Alice, I won't make you change it.

24
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:51,155
 Yes you would, you always make me change things.

25
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:53,155
 Like when?

26
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:56,756
 Last week! Last week I left at work in the kitchen!

27
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:01,756
 I just made some notes in the margin. I was trying to make it sound less dry.

28
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:05,756
 It was a shipping contract. It was supposed to sound dry.

29
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,995
 Look, I'd rather just send it, okay?

30
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,995
 Good! I want you to just send it!

31
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:12,995
 Fine, I will.

32
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:17,995
 Okay, all right, maybe you should take a look.

33
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:23,956
 actually no seriously I'm sorry I'm sorry okay I just I want to get it right

34
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,956
 I'm going to do one more draft.

35
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,956
 Done 15.

36
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,956
 I need to check the spelling.

37
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:30,956
 Run spell check.

38
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:33,756
 I have. I need to check the stuff it missed.

39
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:34,756
 Like what?

40
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:37,876
 I don't know, that's why I need to check it.

41
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:40,156
 This email is the most important thing I've ever done.

42
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,555
 I don't want it to open with dear mum and dad,

43
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,635
 I have something really important to tell you.

44
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,775
 I'm a Lebanon.

45
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:52,775
 Look, Fee, it's late. They'll be in bed. Can't we just wait?

46
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,775
 Wait.

47
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:54,775
 Till when?

48
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:58,775
 I don't know. January?

49
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,775
 What, in 24 hours?

50
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:04,775
 Yes, maybe it can wait 24 hours.

51
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:05,573
 Okay.
