Right. There. I’m ﬁnished.
You’re ﬁnished?
I’m ﬁnished, I’m done, I mean, I think I am, I think it’s done.
Do you want me to have a read?
No. No, it’s ﬁne. Unless . . . do you want to?
If you want me to.
Right, yeah, no, no, you probably should.
OK, I will.
Actually can you not?
No?
No, and it’s not that I don’t want you to, I do, obviously, it’s just I knew you’ll ﬁnd loads wrong with it and then you’ll make me change it and –
I won’t make you change it –
And then I’ll start worrying about all the other things that are wrong with it –
I won’t make you change it.
And then I’ll never actually send it and we’ll be right back where we started
Alice, I won’t make you change it.
Yes, you would! You always make me change things.
Like when?
Last week, last week I left that work in the kitchen –
I made a few notes in the margin, I was just trying to make it sound less dry.
It was a shipping contract, it was supposed to sound dry. Look, I’d rather just send it, OK?
Good, I want you to just send it.
Fine, I will.
OK, alright, maybe you should take a look.
Fine.
Actually no.
Seriously?!
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, OK? I just want to get it right, I just – I’m going to do one more draft.
You’ve done ﬁfteen.
I need to check the spelling.
Run spell-check.
I have. I need to check for stuff it missed.
What stuff?
I don’t know, that’s why I need to check it! Writing this email’s the most important thing I’ve ever done, I don’t want it to open with ‘Dear Mum and Dad, I’ve got something very important to tell you. I’m a Lebanon.’
Look, Fee, it’s late, they’ll be in bed, can’t we just wait?
Till when?
I don’t know, January?
What, you mean in twenty-four hours?
Yes, maybe it can wait twenty-four hours.
Fine. Fine. Wait twenty-four hours. That is absolutely ﬁne.
Well, it obviously isn’t, is it?
No, it is. It’s ﬁne. And y’know why? It means I win the bet.
No it doesn’t.
No?
No. No it does not – I didn’t say I wasn’t going to send it, I just said I wasn’t going to send it tonight.
There’s a difference?
Yes! I am going to send it, OK? But even if I didn’t, you still wouldn’t win the bet, you’ll never win the bet because I’ll still come out before Angelina Jolie because Angelina Jolie is not a – No, y’know what, I’m not rising to this.
Fine.
She’s married.
Divorced.
She’s been married.
He’s gay too.
She’s been married several times.
They’re beards.
