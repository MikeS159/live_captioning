1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Right, then. It's finished.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 You're finished.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I'm finished, I'm done. I mean, I think it's done.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 You want me to have a read?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,199
 No, no, it's fine unless you want to

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,079
 You want me to?

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,940
 Right. Yeah. No, no, you probably should

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,500
 Okay?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,460
 Actually, can you not?

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,679
 No.

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,100
 No, and it's not that I don't want you to.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
 I do, obviously.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,060
 It's just, I know you'll find out what's wrong with it,

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,820
 and then you'll make me change it and then I'll start worrying about all the other things

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,859
 that are wrong with it.

16
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,140
 I won't make you change it.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,659
 And then I'll never actually send it

18
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,380
 and we'll be right back where we started.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,700
 Alice, I won't make you change it.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
 Yes, you would. You always make me change things.

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,700
 Like when?

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,700
 Last week! Last week I left at work in the kitchen!

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
 I just made some notes in the margin. I was trying to make it sound less dry.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,700
 It was a shipping contract. It was supposed to sound dry.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,459
 Look, I'd rather just send it, okay?

26
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,459
 Good. I want you to just send it.

27
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,459
 Time! I will!

28
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,459
 Okay, alright. Maybe you should take a look.

29
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,459
 Why?

30
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,459
 Actually, no.

31
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,459
 Seriously?

32
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,459
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay. I just want to get it right.

33
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,459
 I'm going to do one more draft.

34
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,459
 You've done 15.

35
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,459
 I need to check the spelling.

36
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,459
 Run spell check.

37
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,459
 I have.

38
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,459
 I need to check the stuff it missed.

39
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,459
 Like what?

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,459
 I don't know.

41
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,459
 That's why I need to check it

42
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,859
 The serial is the most important thing I've ever done.

43
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,459
 I don't want it to open with,

44
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,459
 Dear Mum and Dad, I have something really important to tell you. I'm a Lebanon.

45
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:54,459
 Look, Phi. It's late. They'll be in bed. Can't we just wait?

46
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,459
 To what?

47
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,819
 I don't know. January?

48
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,540
 What, in 24 hours?

49
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,540
 Yes, maybe it can wait 24 hours.

50
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
 Okay
